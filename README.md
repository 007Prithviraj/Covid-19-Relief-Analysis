The purpose of this document is to build a covid-19 statistics database based website.
Using this website, the covid-19 statistics for active cases, deaths and recovered can be seen. This website will include a user friendly website for better access of the given data, in addition to the previously specified python based dash board. Our project will include a frontend, backend along with the dashboard using languages such as python, dash, node.js, CSS and HTML. 
Instead of using a database, we will be making use of an open sourced API for accurate data retrieval.
